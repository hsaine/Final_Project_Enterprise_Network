An enterprise desires to manage locally a number of services depending on the
departments. It establishes a network that will allow it to provide services that:

* Deliver IP addresses to devices that connect to the network.
* Turn domain names into IP addresses (and vise-versa).
* Share files over a TCP/IP network.
* Allow the user to access web pages through a browser.
* Transfer email over the network.
* Manage directory services and authentication.

<h2 align="center">Project:</h2>

The task is to build a network divided into two subnets with:

* One DHCP server responsible for delivering addresses to devices connected on both subnets.
* Managing the domain names will be handled by the DNS server.
* The FTP server is used to share files in only one subnet (users on the other subnet
are not allowed to access this service).
* An HTTP server managing two web pages. One is accessible to all hosts, and one
with restricted access (user-password).
* A server managing the email exchange in the company.
* LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is used for directory services and
authentication.
